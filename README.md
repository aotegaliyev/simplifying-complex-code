## Curve Fitting and Design Patterns

This repository showcases a refactored approach to curve fitting using Python, incorporating key design patterns to improve code maintainability, flexibility, and scalability. Initially a junior developerâ€™s code, it has evolved into a clean and structured solution by applying:

- **Strategy Pattern**: Encapsulates various curve-fitting algorithms into distinct classes, making it easy to add or modify fitting methods.
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Separates the core logic of curve fitting and plotting into dedicated service classes, ensuring a cleaner and more manageable codebase.
- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a unified interface for performing complex operations, making it easier to use and extend.

### Key Features:
- **Multiple Curve Fitting Strategies**: Includes Linear, Sigmoid, Exponential, and other curve-fitting methods.
- **Service Layer Implementation**: Separates curve fitting and plotting functionalities into independent services.
- **Dynamic Prediction and Plotting**: Handles various curve fitting scenarios and visualizes results effectively.

### Use Cases:
- Population growth prediction
- Economic forecasting
- Tourism trend analysis
- Stock market analysis
- Sales and revenue forecasting
- Healthcare and epidemic modeling
- Environmental change predictions
- Financial planning

Explore the repository to see how design patterns can significantly enhance your code structure and maintainability. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
